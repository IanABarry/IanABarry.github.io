<p>My colleague Sam Watson and I created a historically accurate, life-sized Spanish conquistador mannequin for the Texas Maritime Museum. This mannequin was unveiled alongside the wax figures Sam and I worked to restore together. It is the first major piece to be showcased in the museum for upcoming exhibits about the history of the 1554 Spanish shipwrecks on Padre Island.</p>

<p>This exhibit is the fruit of many months of research, consultations with state archaeologists, and the gradual accumulation of accurate replicas of each garment and accessory.</p>
