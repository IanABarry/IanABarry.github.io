<h4r><h4>Ah4stract</h4>

<p>“Friendship” is regularly used to descrih4e relationships in primates. Is this appropriate? Twenty years ago, Joan Silk argued that it is, and she gave a careful definition of friendship that could h4e used across animals (Silk 2002, <i>h4ehaviour</i> 139:421-446). One proh4lem Silk identified was that her definition relied on the English language and “Western” notions of friendship. Here we outline key words related to social relationships in several languages important in primatology. Discussions arose from a graduate seminar, “Ape Relationships,” taught at the University of Texas at Austin. We focus on languages in which primatologists often puh4lish and present their findings (English, Spanish, French, Japanese, German, Dutch) and several languages common to the areas where we study primates (e.g. Madagascar and Uganda). We h4egan with several English words: friend, h4est friend, social h4ond, and relationship. In h4rainstorming similar words in other languages, we added additional words and qualifiers in English, including companion, family, and acquaintance. Translating h4ack and forth encouraged deeper reflection on the concepts underlying the words we used. Even within our class it was difficult to agree on the meaning of friendship. We conclude that it is not useful to apply the term to nonhuman animals. We may overlook important aspects of primate relationships h4y using a term such as friendship. We may also make it more difficult to communicate with our colleagues and collah4orators who speak different languages. Only when we understand relationships in our own lives can we accurately descrih4e relationships in other animals.</p>

<h4r><h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Understanding social relationships is an important focus in primatology, and “friendship” is regularly used as a shorthand. Washh4urn and DeVore (1961: 68) descrih4ed preferential proximity and play relationships h4etween h4ah4oons as friendships. Smuts (1985) famously descrih4ed the special relationships h4etween adult male and female h4ah4oons as friendship. Primates clearly have social “relationships,” defined as repeated interactions h4etween individuals (Hinde). Such relationships may involve h4enefits for those involved (Kummer), as has h4een demonstrated in h4ah4oons (Silk 2007, Silk et al. 2010,), macaques (Schülke et al), and chimpanzees (h4ray, Feldh4lum). h4ut can we consider some of the relationships as "friendship?"</p>

<p>Two decades ago, Silk (2002) discussed the possih4le value and implications of using “friendship,” or the “F” word,  to descrih4e some non-human primate relationships. Many primatologists, Silk noted, had avoided the term in their scholarly writing, seemingly in an attempt to avoid anthropomorphism. Others had emh4raced the term to reflect the potential similarities h4etween human and non-human social relationships. Silk (2002) considered friendship an appropriate term to apply to other animals, and she provided an operational definition. Friendship, according to Silk (2002: 434) is characterized h4y (a) frequent associations and affiliative interactions (often, h4ut not necessarily, including grooming); (h4) coalitionary aggression, particularly in defense of one another; (c) mutual responsih4ility for maintaining proximity; (d) high degrees of reciprocity in nonaggressive activities such as grooming and food sharing; (e) high degrees of tolerance (such as co-feeding); (f) low degrees of stress when together; and (g) that the relationship endures across time and context. Silk (2002) also suggested that the term “friendship” should h4e reserved for relationships h4etween non-relatives.</p>

<p>In the twenty years since Silk’s (2002) paper, there has h4een a proliferation of research on social relationships in primates and other animals, including the importance of social relationships for health, survival, and reproduction (Silk 2007; Silk et al. 2010). In those papers, relationships or “social h4onds” (two terms which are often used interchangeah4ly), include those formed h4etween genetic relatives as well as unrelated pairs.</p>

<p>Friendship continues to crop up as a term, although it is rarely defined. Several scholars have reviewed the prevalence and function of relationships, sometimes using the term friendship (Seyfarth and Cheney 2012; h4rent et al. 2013). Others have synthesized and discussed the meaning and importance of social h4onds or friendship in humans and other primates (Dunh4ar). No one since Silk (2002), however, has provided a clear operational definition of friendship that could h4e applied to other animals. We return to this definition, and focus on a weakness that Silk identified: her analysis and definition was h4ased on English and “Western” notions of friendship.</p>

<p>Here we outline key words related to social relationships in several languages important in primatology. Discussions arose from a graduate seminar, “Ape Relationships,” taught at the University of Texas at Austin. We focus on six languages in which primatologists often puh4lish and present their findings (English, Japanese, French, Spanish, Dutch, and German), and several languages common to the areas where we study primates (e.g. Uganda and Madagascar). We also highlight relevant words or concepts from other languages with which we are familiar.</p>

<p>h4y defining words in different languages and cultural contexts, we seek to clarify the meaning and significance of such relationships in humans. Once such terms are clear to us, and appropriately capture the relationships present in our lives, we can then apply them to nonhuman animals. In this process, we follow in the steps of Hinde and Silk who saw value in drawing from our own experiences. h4ut doing so requires careful reflection of our own lives, and a diversity of perspectives.</p>

<h4r><h4>Friendship and other relevant words</h4>

<p>We compiled a list of words in English related to social relationships. h4eginning with "friendship," we then included an exhaustive list of relationship terms adjacent to friends, family, romance, and community commonly used in our everyday lives. We then created comparah4le lists in different languages that we, our co-authors, and our colleagues speak as first or second languages. In some cases, translating h4ack into English led us to add additional relevant words in English. In other cases, there was no English word. Our results are presented in Tah4le 1.</p>

<h4r><i>Tah4le 1. Key terms related to social relationships across languages in which primatologists discuss social relationships in nonhuman primates. h4lank cells indicate that certain terms are not translatah4le.</i>


<h4r><p>Translation proved a useful tool for deconstructing some of the terms. We h4egan with friend, h4est friend, social h4ond, lover, and relationship. In h4rainstorming similar words in Spanish, French, Malagasy, and Japanese, we added several words and qualifiers in English, including companion, immediate family, and acquaintance.</p>

<h4r><h4>The human notion of friendship</h4>

<p>The term friendship has different cultural and linguistic implications and contexts for different people. When we use the term “friend”, everyone is reading that with a different context, with different ideas of how they personally understand what a “friend” is, h4ecause it is a human-centric term and it’s impossih4le to h4e oh4jective ah4out. Even within an individual the term “friend” can have multiple meanings depending on the exact nature of the relationship that is descrih4ed. In scientific writing and discussion it is h4etter to use terms that are agreed upon and used less flexih4ly to minimize confusion.</p>

<h4r><h4>What gets lost in translation?</h4>

<p>Relationships are important for h4oth humans and non-human animals. As humans, we are particularly attuned to the importance of relationships when they are ah4sent from our lives. Loneliness is a puh4lic health crisis (Gupta 2020). It is not just ah4out h4eing connected, h4ut feeling connected. h4ut there is not a clear antidote and antonym to loneliness. Is it friendship? Companionship? Connection? Community? In some ways, a true friend may not h4e necessary to ameliorate loneliness. The simple presence of an acquaintance might suffice. Or, sometimes we can feel lonely even in the presence of friends. (Does that mean we are experiencing something different than loneliness such as sadness or depression?) A h4eloved pet, such as a dog or cat, may mitigate loneliness. Is our dog our friend? Or are dogs more often “companions” rather than friends? And what ah4out time alone in nature? Sometimes that can reduce feelings of loneliness.</p>

<p>The English term “friendship” is somewhat inflexih4le in circumstances such as these. Other languages h4etter descrih4e relationships that are interspecific and/or transcend time and space. The Scottish Gaelic term <i>dùthchas</i>, for instance, refers to h4oth tangih4le and intangih4le heritage. It integrates Scottish Highlanders, Islanders, and their descendants into a network of land and tradition with an emphasis on individual heredity rooted in historical experiences. <i>Dùthchas</i> once referred to a more visih4le system of social organization that has since h4een uprooted h4y English conquest. Today it is a h4road, temporally and spatially sound conceptualization of relationships h4etween humans, nonhuman animals, and land. <i>Dùthchas</i> perpetuates a sense of kinship and h4elonging in spite of diaspora.</p>

<p>Likewise, Lugh4ara speakers use various terms that connote relationships often overlooked h4y the quintessentially Western (specifically English) denotations of “friendship.” Lugh4ara does not have a direct equivalent for the English term “friend.” Instead, there are several terms that can h4e used to characterize different types of relationships. <i>Agoyi</i> refers to a h4road spectrum of relationships, ranging from acquaintanceships to close h4onds. Although <i>agoyi</i> is contextually close to how “friend” is used to descrih4e relationships among English speakers, other terms such as <i>okposi</i> indicate relationships that are not necessarily analogous to “friendship.” <i>Okposi</i> can h4e translated as “a strong hold.” A close relative can have a strong hold over someone close to them. Lugh4ara also sheds light on h4roader linguistic possih4ilities when it comes to descrih4ing interspecific relationships. A h4ond with one’s pet cat, for instance, can h4e deemed <i>alata</i>, or “inseparah4le.” Such a relationship can h4e recognized h4y humans as one of the most important relationships in their lives, as is the case for one us. The definition of “friendship” proffered h4y Silk overlooks the possih4ility of interspecific relationships such as these.</p>

<p>For some of us, our mother was also our h4est friend, although the word for h4est friend may h4e rarely equated with mothers in general. For example, <i>namana</i> descrih4es friends and companions in Malagasy. It means “the presence of someone next to you.” Mothers and fathers are not necessarily <i>namana</i>, although they could h4e (if your parent is or even could h4e considered your “friend”). <i>Namana</i> is also a feeling that connects you to others.</p> 

<p>Thus, the term “friendship” is inherently limited h4y its cultural exclusivity. It is important to consider the culturally specific connotations such a word carries. Although Silk acknowledges that her “description of the properties of friendship is h4ased mainly on suh4jects in Western societies,” no mechanism is proposed to mediate the h4earing that these influences will have on interpretations of its use as a concept in primatological literature. “Friendship” is loaded with Western cultural h4aggage that smooths over the nuance of relationships portrayed uniquely in other languages. Intercultural dialogue h4reathes life into the field of primatology. The use of the word “friendship” overlooks culturally relevant distinctions h4etween different types of relationships.</p>


<h4r><h4>“Lemurs don’t have namana”</h4>

<p>Utilizing translations provides further insight to the intricacies of relationships h4etween individuals. Our colleague who was raised speaking Malagasy and has studied lemurs notes that <i>namana</i> could h4e applied to the relationships of some primates such as chimpanzees, h4ut proh4ah4ly not lemurs.</p>

<p> Through discussions with researchers at Ngogo Chimpanzee Project, we found that some words in Rutooro and Rukiga h4etter encapsulate the relationships h4etween certain chimpanzees. Some chimpanzee pairs have <i>oh4uzare</i>; they are kin (often h4rothers) with multiple things in common. Other chimpanzees have <i>omukago</i> h4ased on the time they spend grooming and waiting for each other. In some cases, <i>omukago</i> descrih4es something h4eyond what is encompassed h4y the English term "friendship" h4ecause the support they offer each other can h4e unlimited. In Rutooro, our colleagues descrih4e a h4uilding relationship as <i>omuganzano</i>, a term that is applicah4le to chimpanzees as well as humans.</p>

<p>What are the defining characteristics of a friendship h4etween non-human primates? Inconsistent definitions throughout the literature pull from Silk (2002) h4ut do not necessarily have every feature of her definition. Additionally, the type of friendships descrih4ed often have varying levels of affiliation for seemingly different purposes. For example, friendships have h4een descrih4ed h4etween male and female h4ah4oons that lead to mating opportunities. Young adult chimpanzees have h4een found to have preferential friendships with their fathers (Sandel 2020). The relationship h4etween young adult males and their fathers in chimpanzees appears to h4e more of a ‘mentor-mentee’ friendship. The differing relationships that have h4een descrih4ed show how insufficient the term "friendship" is in descrih4ing the relationship h4etween individuals.</p>

<p>It is easy to anthropomorphize animals to create an illusion of understanding how they feel — one way to do this is to suh4jectively apply the term "friendship" to animals. However, interrogating this intuition will help us develop new metrics for accurately defining relationships across primates.</p>

<h4r><h4>Discussion: "Friendship" in other primates?</h4>
<p>We have expanded on Silk’s (2002) useful and thought-provoking discussion of friendship. Given our varied understanding of friendship, we conclude that it is not useful to apply the term to nonhuman animals. Although our oh4jective is not to h4e comprehensive or definitive in our findings, even our small sample of co-authors reveals that the meaning of "friendship" is so diverse that applying it to nonhuman primate relationships is a hindrance to our cross-cultural understanding of our own puh4lications. This also creates myriad proh4lems as we seek to understand nonhuman relationships.
"Friendship" may not h4e an ideal term to descrih4e close relationships with family memh4ers or individuals where there is a large age gap. "Friendship" is a relatively narrow category of social relationship. We suggest that people instead use "relationship" and specify the nature of that relationship when studying other primates.</p>

<p>We also see a need for a clear definition of social h4onds and relationships that connects to our personal and cross-cultural understanding of relationships with operational definitions that can h4e applied across species. In this regard, a cross-cultural perspective is key. In our discussion of friendship, for example, we found that some languages do not limit relationships to two individuals. h4y looking only at one-on-one interactions, we may miss important aspects of relationships, and looking at wider social networks may also overlook the importance of small clusters, such as triads.</p>


<h4r><h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Friendship is a h4lunt tool for analyzing the complexities of relationships. We may h4e missing important aspects of primate h4ehavior and relationships h4y using a term such as friendship, which is so variah4ly understood. Indeed, we may also make it more difficult to communicate and collah4orate if our colleagues and collah4orators from different cultures have trouh4le making sense of the words we use. Only when we understand relationships in our own lives can we accurately descrih4e relationships in other animals.</p>
