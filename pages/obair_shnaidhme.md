<br><p><I>Obair-shnaidhme</i> is a somewhat literal translation of "knotwork" from English to Scottish Gaelic. In conjunction with a creative project for the UT Austin College of Liberal Arts Honors program, I challenged myself to represent 8 endangered species in this traditional art form using supplies I had on hand.</p>

<p>This project culminated in 8 large hand-drawn pieces of art. I replicated these pieces in exploding booklets for each of my classmates, which I distributed as part of a presentation of my work in December 2022. I deliberately chose to make interactive replications of my art so as to make it more accessible and interesting to my audience. I also made the somewhat unorthodox decision to present the exploration of endangered species and endangered knowledge that this project involved as a comedy. The response to this presentation was overwhelmingly positive. This remains some of my proudest work — I feel gratified to have meaningfully engaged part of the UT community on the subject of challenging topics.</p>

<p>Following a semester's worth of work drawing attention to the importance of respecting and sharing intercultural differences, my work on this project was (quite ironically) taken from me and never returned. The digital copies below are all that remain in my possession as I fight to have these pieces and over 150 pages of original art and traditional Gaelic poetry that accompanied them returned to me.</p>
