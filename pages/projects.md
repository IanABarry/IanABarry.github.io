<br><b><a href="/whaling_voyages">A Whale of a Tale: Using R to Interactively Visualize American Offshore Whaling Voyages</a></b>
<p>This ongoing independent project explores how whaling voyages can be plotted on a contemporary world map with interactive tools to encourage public engagement. I am using the R programming language to merge, clean, and spatially visualize 3 databases containing different details about offshore whaling voyages between the 18th and 20th centuries.</p>
