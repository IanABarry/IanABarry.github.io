<br><b><a href="/whaling_voyages">A Whale of a Tale: Using R to Interactively Visualize American Offshore Whaling Voyages</a></b>
<p>This ongoing independent project explores how whaling voyages can be plotted on a contemporary world map with interactive tools to encourage public engagement. I am using the R programming language to merge, clean, and spatially visualize 3 databases containing different details about offshore whaling voyages between the 18th and 20th centuries.</p>

<br><b><a href="/wax_figures">Wax Figure Restoration</a></b>
<p>Under the supervision of Dr. Justin Parkoff, Executive Director of the Texas Maritime Museum, my colleague Sam Watson and I cleaned deteriorated wax figures to prepare to bring them back to life. We had the pleasure of inviting the sculptor who created them to see them fully restored over 50 years after they had been put in storage.</p>

<br><b><a href="/obair_shnaidhme">Endangered Species as Obair-Shnaidhme: Connecting Culture and Nature Through Art</a></b>
<p>Obair-shnaidhme</i> is a somewhat literal translation of "knotwork" from English to Scottish Gaelic. In conjunction with a creative project for the UT Austin College of Liberal Arts Honors program, I challenged myself to represent 8 endangered species in this traditional art form using supplies I had on hand. I showcased these pieces in an interactive presentation.</p>

<br><b><a href="/1554_project">1554 Shipwrecks</a></b>
<p>My colleague Sam Watson and I created a historically accurate, life-sized Spanish conquistador mannequin for the Texas Maritime Museum. This mannequin was unveiled alongside the wax figures Sam and I worked to restore together and is the first major piece to be showcased in the museum for upcoming exhibits about the history of the 1554 Spanish shipwrecks on Padre Island.</p>
