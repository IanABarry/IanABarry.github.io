<br><b><a href="/whaling_voyages">A Whale of a Tale: Using R to Interactively Visualize American Offshore Whaling Voyages</a></b>
<p>This ongoing independent project explores how whaling voyages can be plotted on a contemporary world map with interactive tools to encourage public engagement. I am using the R programming language to merge, clean, and spatially visualize 3 databases containing different details about offshore whaling voyages between the 18th and 20th centuries.</p>

<br><b><a href="/obair_shnaidhme">Endangered Species as Obair-Shnaidhme: Connecting Culture and Nature Through Art</a></b>
<p>Obair-shnaidhme</i> is a somewhat literal translation of "knotwork" from English to Scottish Gaelic. In conjunction with a creative project for the UT Austin College of Liberal Arts Honors program, I challenged myself to represent 8 endangered species in this traditional art form using supplies I had on hand. I showcased these pieces in an interactive presentation.</p>
