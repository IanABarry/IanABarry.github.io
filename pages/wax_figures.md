Under the supervision of Dr. Justin Parkoff, Executive Director of the Texas Maritime Museum, my colleague Sam Watson and I cleaned deteriorated wax figures to prepare to bring them back to life. We had the pleasure of inviting the sculptor who created them to see them fully restored over 50 years after they had been put in storage.

<br><p>The gravity of the moment Ms. Rees saw her sculptures again wasn't lost on me. When I had first been invited to clean her sculptures in preparation for restoration, I never imagined we would reconnect with the artist who created them. Ms. Rees passed her 100th birthday in winter 2022. It was a privilege to be present when she was reconnected with her work.</p>

<br><p>This wax figure family was initially created as part of an exhibit for a museum in Corpus Christi intended to educate the public about Indigenous peoples on the Texas coast. The museum's administration removed them after a short time on display. They were replaced with exhibits intended to perpetuate dehumanizing stereotypes about Indigenous peoples in Texas.</p>

<br><p>Sam and I cleaned the base plates of each sculpture of wax residue and dirt that had built up on them over the course of many decades in poor storage conditions. We treated the iron plates with phosphoric acid to prevent them from rusting further, then filled the spaces under their feet with soft foam molded to provide maximum support.</p>

<br><p>This restoration work is part of an ongoing project that engages Texas citizens in re-humanizing the history of the Texas coast. As outreach for this project expands, more cultural, historical, and archaeological perspectives are emerging that challenge the dominant historical narrative endorsed by the state of Texas.</p>
