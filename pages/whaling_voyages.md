<b>This project will be presented at the University of Texas at Austin's Day of Digital Humanities symposium on April 14, 2023!</b>
<br><i>More project information coming soon.</i>

<br><p>Whaling ship logbooks offer a wealth of insight into human nature unlike any other records kept throughout human history. They provide glimpses into human interactions with one another, with unfamiliar environments, and with natural resources. They also record weather events and sightings of marine creatures that inform our present understanding of global climate change and ocean biodiversity.</p>

<p>This ongoing project uses the R programming language to merge, clean, and spatially visualize U.S. whaling voyage data compiled between the 18th and early 20th centuries. This data originates from three separate databases compiled by Lieutenant Commander Matthew Fontaine Maury, Charles Haskins Townsend, and the Census of Marine Life project, respectively.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this project explores how whaling voyages can be plotted on a contemporary world map with interactive tools to encourage public engagement. In addition to tracing the historical routes of whaling ships, this map elucidates when and where whales were sighted or killed, provides information about crew members, and visually investigates an evolving sense of space and place through visualization of important landmarks. In so doing, it tells a whale of a tale about changing land- and oceanscapes through the eyes of people from the past.</p>
